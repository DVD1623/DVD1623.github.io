        <h1>David's Biography</h1>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My full name is Jiawen Hou, but I prefer to be referred as David. I was born in Hainan, China in 1997. Hainan was the southest province in China, surrounded by ocean. I lived In Hainan until 4 years old and moved to Shaanxi Province because of the outburst of SARS virus. I lived with my grandparents for two years, and then moved to Beijing with my parents when I was 6 years old. I lived in Beijng ever since until I came to America to study in Tufts.
